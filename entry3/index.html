            <!-- PARAGRAPH 1 -->
            <p><a href="../index.html" class="escapism-link">ESCAPISM</a> is a harmonic collection exploring the human urge to step out of our own heads. <span class="escapism-highlight">ESCAPISM</span> is the tendency to seek distraction and relief from unpleasant realities, primarily through entertainment or fantasy. But what defines your reality? Are you escaping from the physical into the digital, or the other way around? And when does a momentary break become something you can't control?</p>
            
            <!-- PARAGRAPH 2 -->
            <p>In the modern age, <span class="escapism-highlight">ESCAPISM</span> manifests in countless ways: endlessly scrolling through social media feeds at 3 am, binge-watching entire seasons in one sitting, doom-scrolling through news cycles. We lose ourselves in someone else's curated life on Instagram, in fictional worlds through Netflix, and in the validation of notifications and likes. We tell ourselves we're taking a break, finding relief, seeking connection. But these acts of escape often trap us in loops we don't notice until hours have passed.</p>
            
            <!-- PARAGRAPH 3  -->
            <p>Beyond the digital, <span class="escapism-highlight">ESCAPISM</span> takes other forms too—planning elaborate futures to avoid uncomfortable presents, losing ourselves in work to avoid personal issues, or simply putting on headphones to disconnect from the world around us. Every day, we pass by thousands of people, yet we rarely acknowledge their existence, choosing instead to retreat into our own bubbles.</p>
            
            <!-- PARAGRAPH 4 -->
            <p><a href="../index.html" class="escapism-link">ESCAPISM</a> invites you into spaces that mirror these experiences. Through interactive entries, you'll encounter the questions people ask themselves late at night on Reddit, the behaviors we repeat without thinking, and the confronting moments when we realize how much time has passed while we were somewhere else. Each entry asks: What are you escaping from? Why couldn't you stop? What does being stuck actually look like?</p>
            
            <!-- PARAGRAPH 5 -->
            <p>This project is conceived and created by Naomi Sumampow under the guidance of <a href="http://www.severinbunse.com" target="_blank" class="teacher-link">Severin Bunse</a> for Core 1: Interaction at Parsons School of Design.</p>
            
            <!-- PARAGRAPH 6 -->
            <p>Through <a href="../index.html" class="escapism-link">ESCAPISM</a>, you'll recognize the loops you create, the time you lose, and the reality you avoid.</p>
