                <!-- PARAGRAPH 1 -->
                <p>What was I supposed to be doing again...  
                I opened this page for a reason... I'm pretty sure I did...  
                but the second the screen lit up, my brain drifted somewhere else...  
                and now I'm just sitting here... thinking... not thinking... hovering...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 2 -->
                <p>I check one thing... then another...  
                then forget why I checked anything at all...  
                My mind feels like it's flipping through tabs too fast for me to follow...  
                leaving thoughts half-loaded... half-remembered... half-abandoned...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 3 -->
                <p>Should I reply to that message...  
                Should I check if I missed something...  
                Should I close everything and breathe for a second...  
                My brain keeps switching apps inside my head without permission...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 4 -->
                <p>I keep remembering things I don't need right now...  
                random conversations... old notifications...  
                mistakes I thought I forgot... and plans I still haven't started...  
                They pop up like alerts I never turned off...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 5 -->
                <p>I try to focus, but everything scatters...  
                like trying to hold water with open hands...  
                One thought runs into another...  
                and I follow the wrong one every time...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 6 -->
                <p>The silence around me feels heavy...  
                but the screen feels louder than anything else...  
                so I stay here a little longer...  
                letting the glow replace the things I'm avoiding...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 7 -->
                <p>It's strange how thinking feels like scrolling...  
                you move and move and move...  
                but you don't go anywhere...  
                you just refresh the same feelings in different colors...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 8 -->
                <p>Sometimes I catch myself reloading the same thought...  
                as if the next version will make more sense...  
                as if the third or fourth or fifth replay will finally explain something...  
                but it never does...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 9 -->
                <p>I drift off without meaning to...  
                then snap back like waking from a dream I wasn't really dreaming...  
                My mind wanders to places I didn't choose...  
                and I act like I'm the one steering...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 10 -->
                <p>I tell myself I'm taking a short break...  
                just until I feel normal again...  
                just until the heaviness lifts a little...  
                but "a little" always turns into longer...  
                and longer always turns into "where did the last hour go...?"</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 11 -->
                <p>Sometimes I think I'm escaping from thoughts I don't want to hold...  
                and sometimes I think I'm escaping from the quiet that forces me to hold them...  
                I can't tell which one is worse...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 12 -->
                <p>My body stays still...  
                but my thoughts keep pacing...  
                jumping to old memories... unfinished tasks...  
                imagined scenarios that feel real enough to exhaust me...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 13 -->
                <!-- I explore different versions of self lost in digital noise -->
                <p>I keep wandering between versions of myself...  
                the one I want to be...  
                the one I pretend to be...  
                the one I avoid...  
                the one I keep losing track of in the noise...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 14 -->
                <p>I scroll through my thoughts the way I scroll through feeds...  
                quickly... aimlessly... compulsively...  
                searching for something that makes me feel less scattered...  
                less overwhelmed...  
                less alone...  
                less everything...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 15 -->
                <p>Nothing sticks...  
                everything blurs...  
                and it becomes strangely comforting...  
                to disappear inside my own head for a while...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 16 -->
                <p>I drift...  
                I return...  
                I drift again...  
                and maybe this wandering is the only part of me that still feels honest.  
                Maybe this is my version of escape...  
                or my version of coping...  
                or just the place my mind goes when the world feels too sharp to sit with...</p>

                <!-- PARAGRAPH 17 -->
                <p>I don't know whether I'm escaping from something...  
                or escaping toward something...  
                or just escaping because it's easier than being fully present...  
                But for now... I'm here...  
                half-thinking... half-floating...  
                letting my thoughts wander without asking them to come back.</p>
